📌 Project Overview: Wildlife Conservation System
🎯 Objective
The system is designed to facilitate wildlife conservation efforts by enabling functionalities such as species management, donations, and user authentication. It allows users to donate, manage conservation records, and track species information while ensuring secure login and user role management.

🛠️ Technologies Used
✅ Java EE (Servlets & JSP) – Backend logic
✅ JDBC (MySQL Database) – Database connectivity
✅ MVC Architecture – Organized code structure
✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend for UI
✅ Session Management – User authentication & login persistence

📌 System Workflow
1️⃣ User visits the website → Views conservation info
2️⃣ User logs in/registers (or continues as guest)
3️⃣ Donates to wildlife causes (stored in DB)
4️⃣ Admins manage conservation data
5️⃣ Users can track contributions

📌 Possible Enhancements
🚀 Add email notifications for donation confirmations
🚀 Implement QR code payment for mobile donations
🚀 Enable export reports for admin analytics
🚀 Improve UI with Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS

📌 Conclusion
Your Wildlife Conservation System is a well-structured Java web application focused on donations, user authentication, and species management. It follows MVC architecture, ensuring separation of concerns, and uses session management to differentiate between guests and registered users.
